This is a cutomized template for the vscode plugin **marp**, which is a wonderful tool to convert markdown files to slides easily. 

## Features✨

- changed the colorscheme, using my favourite color #4892ec.
- changed the font, using the [LXGW WenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai), which is friendly to both Chinese and English Displaying.🧐

## Note🔔

- you may first install the required font if you want to have the right font display.
